# iobit

***A microbit office badge that lets coworkers know where you are and when you'll be back***
*A project for Microsoft OneWeek 2016*

Use the microbit and its built in display to connect to your phone via BLE and sync with your outlook calendar. When you are not in your office, curious coworkers can use the buttons on the microbit to display information on where you currently are and your ETA back in your office.
